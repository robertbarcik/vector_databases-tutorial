        "   - **Long documents** (articles, papers): Use lower n_results (2-5)\n",
        "   - **Chunked documents**: Consider 5-10 chunks\n",

        "**3. Consider your LLM's context window:**\n",

        "   - If the 3rd result has a distance > 0.5, the remaining results probably won't help\n",
