The fundamental challenge it solves is that of key distribution, which was the Achilles' heel of symmetric systems requiring a shared secret key to be exchanged over a secure channel beforehand. Introduced conceptually by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in their seminal 1976 paper \"New Directions in Cryptography,\" this system utilizes pairs of mathematically linked keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared openly without compromising security, while the private key must be kept secret by its owner. This ingenious design allows for two primary functions: encryption and digital signatures. For encryption, a sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt a message, which can then only be decrypted by the recipient using their corresponding private key. This ensures confidentiality even when communicating over a hostile, monitored network like the internet. For digital signatures, a sender uses their own private key to sign a message, and anyone with their public key can verify the signature's authenticity, ensuring both integrity and non-repudiation. The security of these systems relies on the computational difficulty of 'one-way functions' with a 'trapdoor,' where it is easy to compute in one direction but infeasible to reverse without the secret information of the private key. The first practical and widely used implementation was the RSA algorithm, developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, which bases its security on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. Over time, other algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) have gained prominence, offering equivalent security with much smaller key sizes, making them ideal for resource-constrained devices like smartphones. The practical application of public-key cryptography is managed through a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is a framework of policies and procedures that uses a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), to issue digital certificates that bind public keys to specific identities. This is the trust model that underpins the entire secure web, enabling protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which secures HTTPS traffic. Its influence extends to securing email with PGP, remote shell access with SSH, and forming the transactional backbone of virtually all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. However, the rise of quantum computing poses a significant future threat to current public-key algorithms, as they can theoretically solve the underlying mathematical problems efficiently. This has spurred the development of a new field called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which aims to create a new generation of secure algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers.\"\"\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"id\": \"document_2\",\n","        \"text\": \"\"\"Stuxnet stands as a watershed moment in the history of digital warfare, a malicious computer worm that transcended the digital realm to cause tangible, physical destruction.

The fundamental challenge it solves is that of key distribution, which was the Achilles' heel of symmetric systems requiring a shared secret key to be exchanged over a secure channel beforehand. Introduced conceptually by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in their seminal 1976 paper \"New Directions in Cryptography,\" this system utilizes pairs of mathematically linked keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared openly without compromising security, while the private key must be kept secret by its owner. This ingenious design allows for two primary functions: encryption and digital signatures. For encryption, a sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt a message, which can then only be decrypted by the recipient using their corresponding private key. This ensures confidentiality even when communicating over a hostile, monitored network like the internet. For digital signatures, a sender uses their own private key to sign a message, and anyone with their public key can verify the signature's authenticity, ensuring both integrity and non-repudiation. The security of these systems relies on the computational difficulty of 'one-way functions' with a 'trapdoor,' where it is easy to compute in one direction but infeasible to reverse without the secret information of the private key. The first practical and widely used implementation was the RSA algorithm, developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, which bases its security on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. Over time, other algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) have gained prominence, offering equivalent security with much smaller key sizes, making them ideal for resource-constrained devices like smartphones. The practical application of public-key cryptography is managed through a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is a framework of policies and procedures that uses a trusted third party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA), to issue digital certificates that bind public keys to specific identities. This is the trust model that underpins the entire secure web, enabling protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which secures HTTPS traffic. Its influence extends to securing email with PGP, remote shell access with SSH, and forming the transactional backbone of virtually all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. However, the rise of quantum computing poses a significant future threat to current public-key algorithms, as they can theoretically solve the underlying mathematical problems efficiently. This has spurred the development of a new field called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which aims to create a new generation of secure algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers.\n","\n"," Embedding length: \n"," 1536\n","\n"," Embedding vector: \n"," [ 0.01524434 -0.03487886  0.04341667 ... -0.02466746 -0.01395882\n","  0.00194951]\n"]}],"source":["# Retrieving embedding\n","row = openai_collection.get(ids = [\"document_1\"], include = [\"documents\", \"embeddings\"])\n","\n","print(\"Original document:\\n\", row[\"documents\"][0])\n","print(\"\\n Embedding length: \\n\", len(row[\"embeddings\"][0]))\n","print(\"\\n Embedding vector: \\n\", row[\"embeddings\"][0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VXnJ475brlNi"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
