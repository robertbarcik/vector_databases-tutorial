    "\n",
    "## Welcome to Graph Databases!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to use **graph databases** to model and query complex, interconnected data. While vector databases excel at similarity search, graph databases are optimized for understanding and traversing **relationships** between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core graph database concepts: nodes, relationships, and properties\n",
    "- **Cypher query language** for pattern matching and graph traversal\n",
    "- Building knowledge graphs from structured data\n",
    "- Advanced pattern matching and multi-hop relationship queries\n",
    "- When to use graph databases vs. vector databases in your AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíº Business Value: Why Graph Databases Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases power some of the world's most critical applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: LinkedIn uses graphs to show \"how you're connected\" to other professionals\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: Banks detect fraud rings by analyzing transaction networks in real-time\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix and Amazon use graphs to find \"people like you\" and recommend content\n",
    "- **Knowledge Management**: Enterprises build knowledge graphs to connect documents, people, projects, and expertise\n",
    "- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Companies model complex supply networks to identify bottlenecks and risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional databases that struggle with complex joins across multiple tables, graph databases are designed to traverse relationships at lightning speed‚Äîeven across millions of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîó How This Connects to Your Previous Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already learned about:\n",
    "- **Vector databases**: Great for similarity search (\"find documents similar to this\")\n",
    "- **RAG systems**: Retrieve relevant context for LLM queries\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex**: Orchestrate data ingestion and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases complement these tools by adding **relationship intelligence**. In the next notebook, you'll combine graph databases with vector search to create **GraphRAG**‚Äîthe next evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n",

    "## üìö Part 1: Theory - What Are Graph Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A **graph database** stores data as a network of interconnected nodes and relationships, rather than rows and tables. This structure mirrors how we naturally think about connected information: people know people, products belong to categories, documents cite other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional **relational databases** require complex JOIN operations to traverse relationships. As you add more joins (\"find friends of friends of friends\"), performance degrades exponentially. **Document databases** like MongoDB store data as self-contained documents, but struggle to represent complex relationships efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases solve this by making relationships **first-class citizens**. Relationships are stored directly alongside the data, enabling constant-time traversal regardless of database size. A query that finds \"friends within 3 degrees of separation\" executes in milliseconds even with millions of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîë Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Every graph database is built from three fundamental elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes** (also called vertices): Represent entities in your domain\n",
    "   - Examples: Person, Company, Product, Document\n",
    "   - Have **labels** to categorize them (e.g., `:Employee`, `:Department`)\n",
    "   - Contain **properties** with key-value data (e.g., `name: \"Sarah\"`, `age: 35`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationships** (also called edges): Connect nodes and represent how they're related\n",
    "   - Examples: WORKS_FOR, PURCHASED, KNOWS, MANAGES\n",
    "   - Always have a **direction** (though you can query in either direction)\n",
    "   - Also contain **properties** (e.g., `since: 2020`, `strength: 0.8`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Properties**: Key-value pairs that store data on nodes and relationships\n",
    "   - Examples: `salary: 75000`, `created_at: \"2024-01-15\"`, `priority: \"high\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ When to Use Graph Databases vs. Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **graph databases** when:\n",
    "- Your data has complex, multi-hop relationships (organizational hierarchies, social networks)\n",
    "- You need to answer \"how are these connected?\" questions\n",
    "- Relationships are as important as the entities themselves\n",
    "- You're detecting patterns across connections (fraud rings, influence networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **vector databases** when:\n",
    "- You need semantic similarity search (\"find documents similar to this query\")\n",
    "- Your data is unstructured (text, images, audio)\n",
    "- Relationships are less important than content similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The best systems use **both**: vector search to find relevant content, graph traversal to understand context and relationships. You'll learn this hybrid approach in Notebook 2!\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LinkedIn Connections**: \"How are you connected to this person?\" requires traversing the professional network graph\n",
    "2. **Fraud Detection**: Banks analyze transaction graphs to find suspicious patterns‚Äîmultiple accounts transferring to the same destination\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Engines**: \"Users who bought X also bought Y\" is a graph traversal problem\n",
    "4. **Drug Discovery**: Pharmaceutical companies use knowledge graphs to find relationships between proteins, diseases, and compounds\n",
    "5. **IT Operations**: Map dependencies between services to understand cascade failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Key Point: The Power of Relationship Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, finding \"friends of friends\" requires multiple self-joins that get exponentially slower. In a graph database, you simply follow the relationships‚Äîperformance stays constant regardless of how many \"hops\" you traverse. This is called **index-free adjacency**, and it's what makes graph databases uniquely powerful for connected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph databases store data as **nodes** (entities) connected by **relationships**\n",
    "- Relationships are stored directly, enabling fast traversal across millions of connections\n",
    "- Unlike relational databases, query performance doesn't degrade with relationship depth\n",
    "- Graph databases excel at \"how are these connected?\" questions\n",
    "- They complement vector databases‚Äîuse graphs for relationships, vectors for similarity\n",
    "- Real-world applications: social networks, fraud detection, recommendations, knowledge management"

    "## üî§ Part 3: Cypher Basics - The Graph Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Cypher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cypher** is Neo4j's query language for working with graphs. If you know SQL, you'll find Cypher familiar but more intuitive for connected data. Instead of thinking about tables and joins, you think about **patterns** in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher uses ASCII art to represent graph patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "()                    // A node\n",
    "(p:Person)            // A node with label 'Person', aliased as 'p'\n",
    "(p:Person {name: \"Sarah\"})  // A node with properties\n",
    "\n",
    "-->                   // A relationship (directed)\n",
    "-[r]->                // A relationship, aliased as 'r'\n",
    "-[:KNOWS]->           // A relationship with type 'KNOWS'\n",
    "-[:KNOWS {since: 2020}]->  // A relationship with properties\n",
    "\n",
    "(p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)  // A complete pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Cypher Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: Add new nodes and relationships to the graph\n",
    "- **MATCH**: Find patterns in the graph (like SQL's SELECT)\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Filter results based on conditions\n",
    "- **RETURN**: Specify what data to return\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Remove nodes and relationships (use DETACH DELETE to remove relationships too)\n",
    "- **MERGE**: Create if doesn't exist, or match if it does (prevents duplicates)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Key Point: Cypher's Pattern-Matching Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of Cypher is in pattern matching. Instead of writing complex joins, you simply **draw the pattern** you're looking for using ASCII art. The database figures out how to traverse the graph efficiently. Want to find \"people who work with people who know each other\"? Just write the pattern:\n",

    "Now that our knowledge graph is built, we can unleash the real power of graph databases: **pattern matching** and **relationship traversal**. Unlike SQL joins that get slower with complexity, graph traversals maintain constant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-hop queries**: Direct relationships (employee ‚Üí department)\n",
    "- **Multi-hop queries**: Chained relationships (employee ‚Üí project ‚Üí other employees)\n",
    "- **Variable-length paths**: Find connections within N degrees\n",
    "- **Aggregations**: Count, collect, and analyze patterns\n",
    "- **Pattern combinations**: Complex queries matching multiple patterns simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Key Point: Traversal Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j's **index-free adjacency** means each node physically stores references to its connected relationships. Traversing from one node to another is a simple pointer lookup‚Äîno index searches required. This is why graph databases can traverse millions of relationships in milliseconds, while relational databases struggle with just a few joins.\n",

    "## ‚úÖ Part 8: Best Practices & Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Best Practices for Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand graph fundamentals, let's discuss how to build production-quality graph applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **When to Use Graph Databases**\n",
    "‚úÖ **Use graph databases when:**\n",
    "- Your data has complex, multi-hop relationships (social networks, org charts)\n",
    "- You need to traverse relationships frequently (\"friends of friends\", supply chains)\n",
    "- Relationship queries are central to your application\n",
    "- Your schema evolves frequently (graphs are schema-flexible)\n",
    "- You need real-time pattern matching (fraud detection, recommendations)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Don't use graph databases when:**\n",
    "- You primarily need simple CRUD operations on independent records\n",
    "- Your queries rarely involve relationships (use document DB instead)\n",
    "- You need pure analytical aggregations (use data warehouse instead)\n",
    "- Relationships are sparse and simple (relational DB may suffice)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Cypher Query Optimization**\n",
    "- **Start with specific nodes**: Use indexed properties to anchor your queries\n",
    "  ```cypher\n",
    "  // ‚úÖ Good: Starts with indexed lookup\n",
    "  MATCH (e:Employee {id: \"emp001\"})-[:MANAGES]->(reports)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // ‚ùå Bad: Scans all employees first\n",
    "  MATCH (e:Employee)-[:MANAGES]->(reports)\n",
    "  WHERE e.id = \"emp001\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limit relationship traversal depth**: Unbounded traversals can be expensive\n",
    "  ```cypher\n",
    "  // ‚úÖ Good: Limited depth\n",
    "  MATCH path = (a)-[*1..4]-(b)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // ‚ùå Bad: Could traverse entire graph\n",
    "  MATCH path = (a)-[*]-(b)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use PROFILE and EXPLAIN**: Understand query execution plans\n",
    "  ```cypher\n",
    "  PROFILE MATCH (e:Employee)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill {name: \"Python\"})\n",
    "  RETURN e.name\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Indexing and Constraints**\n",
    "Always create indexes and constraints for properties you query frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "// Unique constraints (also create indexes)\n",
    "CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (e:Employee) REQUIRE e.id IS UNIQUE\n",
    "\n",
    "// Indexes for frequent lookups\n",
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (e:Employee) ON (e.name)\n",
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Project) ON (p.status)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Graph Modeling Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes vs. Properties:**\n",
    "- Make something a **node** if:\n",
    "  - It has relationships to other entities\n",
    "  - You'll query it independently\n",
    "  - It appears in multiple contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make something a **property** if:\n",
    "  - It's a simple attribute (name, age, status)\n",
    "  - It doesn't need relationships\n",
    "  - It's specific to one entity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "// ‚úÖ Good: Skills are nodes (can be shared, have relationships)\n",
    "(Employee)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(Skill {name: \"Python\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "// ‚ùå Bad: Skills as properties (can't find \"who else has this skill?\")\n",
    "(Employee {skills: [\"Python\", \"SQL\"]})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Relationship Direction Matters**\n",
    "- Always define relationship direction logically (even if you query both ways)\n",
    "- Use descriptive relationship types: `MANAGES`, `WORKS_IN`, not `RELATED_TO`\n",
    "- You can traverse relationships in any direction regardless of how they're stored:\n",
    "  ```cypher\n",
    "  // Stored direction: (Manager)-[:MANAGES]->(Employee)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Query in stored direction\n",
    "  MATCH (m:Employee)-[:MANAGES]->(e:Employee)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Query in reverse direction\n",
    "  MATCH (e:Employee)<-[:MANAGES]-(m:Employee)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // Query ignoring direction\n",
    "  MATCH (e1:Employee)-[:MANAGES]-(e2:Employee)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Testing Queries Incrementally**\n",
    "Build complex queries step by step:\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "// Step 1: Find the anchor node\n",
    "MATCH (e:Employee {name: \"Sarah Chen\"})\n",
    "RETURN e\n",
    "\n",
    "// Step 2: Add one relationship\n",
    "MATCH (e:Employee {name: \"Sarah Chen\"})-[:MANAGES]->(reports)\n",
    "RETURN e, reports\n",
    "\n",
    "// Step 3: Add filters and aggregations\n",
    "MATCH (e:Employee {name: \"Sarah Chen\"})-[:MANAGES]->(reports)\n",
    "WHERE reports.years_experience > 5\n",
    "RETURN e.name, collect(reports.name) as experienced_reports\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overmodeling (too many node types)**\n",
    "   - Don't create a node type for every possible entity\n",
    "   - Example: Don't create `:StreetAddress`, `:City`, `:State` as separate nodes if you only need address data as properties\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not using indexes for frequent lookups**\n",
    "   - If you query `WHERE e.email = \"...\"` often, create an index on `email`\n",
    "   - Indexes dramatically improve query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ignoring relationship direction**\n",
    "   - Define relationships in the natural direction: `(Employee)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(Company)`\n",
    "   - Don't use bidirectional relationships unless truly needed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Over-relying on properties instead of relationships**\n",
    "   - If you're filtering by a property frequently, consider making it a node\n",
    "   - Example: Instead of `(Employee {department: \"Engineering\"})`, use `(Employee)-[:WORKS_IN]->(Department {name: \"Engineering\"})`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not cleaning up test data**\n",
    "   - Always use `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` to clear test graphs\n",
    "   - In production, use careful WHERE clauses to delete only specific data\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Writing queries that scan the entire graph**\n",
    "   - Always start queries with an indexed lookup or specific node match\n",
    "   - Avoid queries like `MATCH (n) WHERE n.name = \"Alice\"` (scans everything)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph databases excel at connected data**‚Äîuse them when relationships matter\n",
    "- **Index frequently queried properties** for performance\n",
    "- **Model thoughtfully**: nodes for entities with relationships, properties for attributes\n",
    "- **Relationship direction is semantic**, but you can query in any direction\n",
    "- **Test queries incrementally**‚Äîbuild complexity step by step\n",
    "- **Avoid overmodeling**‚Äînot everything needs to be a node\n",
    "- **Profile your queries** to understand and optimize performance\n",
    "- **Graph databases complement vector databases**‚Äîuse both for GraphRAG!\n",
