The answer now highlighted evaluation methods like mathematical equivalence, instruction following, and user chat assessments, as well as the problem of benchmarks discouraging \"I don’t know\" responses. This aligns much more closely with the original text in Appendix F, making the response both faithful and relevant.\n",
