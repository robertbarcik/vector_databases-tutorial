        "\n",
        "### **Decision Guide:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use `compact` when:**\n",
        "- ✅ You have 2-5 short chunks\n",
        "- ✅ Fast response time is important\n",
        "- ✅ You're prototyping or testing\n",
        "- ✅ Cost is a concern\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use `refine` when:**\n",
        "- ✅ Answer quality is paramount\n",
        "- ✅ You need comprehensive answers from multiple sources\n",
        "- ✅ Chunks contain complementary information\n",
        "- ✅ You can afford the extra API calls\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use `tree_summarize` when:**\n",
        "- ✅ You have many chunks (10+)\n",
        "- ✅ You're doing summarization\n",
        "- ✅ You want balanced treatment of all chunks\n",
        "- ✅ Moderate cost/quality trade-off is acceptable\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Pro Tips:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start with `compact`** - It's the default for a reason. Only switch if you have a specific need.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Monitor token usage** - In production, track how many tokens each mode uses. `refine` can get expensive quickly!\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with your data** - The \"best\" mode depends on your specific documents and queries. Run experiments!\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider hybrid approaches** - You can use `compact` for simple queries and `refine` for complex ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Remember: Good retrieval matters more** - A perfect synthesis mode can't fix bad retrieval. Focus on metadata, chunking, and filtering first!\n",
