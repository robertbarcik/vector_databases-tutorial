## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Google Colab account (free)
- OpenAI API key (for Notebook 2 only)

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Upload to Google Colab:**
   - Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
   - Click `File ‚Üí Upload notebook`
   - Select the notebook file

2. **For Notebook 1:**
   - Simply run all cells in order
   - No API keys needed!

3. **For Notebook 2:**
   - Upload `api_keys.txt` with your OpenAI API key
   - Or manually set the API key in the configuration cell
   - Run all cells in order

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Notebook 1:
- Neo4j Community Edition 4.4.36 (installed via script)
- Python packages: neo4j, py2neo, pandas, matplotlib, networkx

### Notebook 2:
- All dependencies from Notebook 1, plus:
- OpenAI Python SDK
- LlamaIndex (core + graph stores + vector stores)
- ChromaDB
- LlamaIndex integrations for Neo4j and OpenAI

All dependencies are installed automatically within the notebooks!

## üéØ Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. Complete Notebook 1 first to understand graph database fundamentals
2. Then proceed to Notebook 2 to learn GraphRAG and automation

**Time estimate:**
- Notebook 1: 1-2 hours
- Notebook 2: 2-3 hours

## üìñ Key Concepts Covered

### Graph Database Concepts:
- Nodes, relationships, properties
- Cypher query language
- Pattern matching and traversal
- Index-free adjacency
- Graph modeling best practices

### GraphRAG Concepts:
- Entity extraction with LLMs
- Knowledge graph automation
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Hybrid retrieval strategies
- Multi-hop reasoning
- Entity disambiguation

## üéì Educational Design

Both notebooks follow educational best practices:
- **Theory first:** Each section starts with conceptual explanations
- **Hands-on examples:** Immediately apply concepts with code
- **Real-world scenarios:** Use realistic business/research contexts
- **Progressive complexity:** Start simple, gradually add sophistication
- **Visual learning:** Include visualizations and diagrams
- **Practice exercises:** Suggested extensions for deeper learning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

- **Neo4j Installation:** Uses tarball-based installation for Colab compatibility
- **API Model:** Uses OpenAI's `client.responses.create()` format with gpt-5-nano
- **Vector Store:** ChromaDB in ephemeral mode (in-memory for Colab)
- **Graph Store:** Neo4j Community Edition running locally in Colab VM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Colab Runtime:** Neo4j runs in the Colab VM and resets when runtime restarts
2. **API Costs:** Notebook 2 makes OpenAI API calls - monitor usage
3. **Data Persistence:** All data is ephemeral; nothing is saved between sessions
4. **Neo4j Browser:** Not directly accessible in Colab; use matplotlib visualizations
