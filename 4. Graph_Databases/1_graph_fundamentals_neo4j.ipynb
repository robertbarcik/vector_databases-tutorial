    "# 📊 Graph Database Fundamentals with Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to Graph Databases!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to use **graph databases** to model and query complex, interconnected data. While vector databases excel at similarity search, graph databases are optimized for understanding and traversing **relationships** between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core graph database concepts: nodes, relationships, and properties\n",
    "- **Cypher query language** for pattern matching and graph traversal\n",
    "- Building knowledge graphs from structured data\n",
    "- Advanced pattern matching and multi-hop relationship queries\n",
    "- When to use graph databases vs. vector databases in your AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💼 Business Value: Why Graph Databases Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases power some of the world's most critical applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: LinkedIn uses graphs to show \"how you're connected\" to other professionals\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: Banks detect fraud rings by analyzing transaction networks in real-time\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix and Amazon use graphs to find \"people like you\" and recommend content\n",
    "- **Knowledge Management**: Enterprises build knowledge graphs to connect documents, people, projects, and expertise\n",
    "- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Companies model complex supply networks to identify bottlenecks and risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional databases that struggle with complex joins across multiple tables, graph databases are designed to traverse relationships at lightning speed—even across millions of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 How This Connects to Your Previous Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already learned about:\n",
    "- **Vector databases**: Great for similarity search (\"find documents similar to this\")\n",
    "- **RAG systems**: Retrieve relevant context for LLM queries\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex**: Orchestrate data ingestion and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases complement these tools by adding **relationship intelligence**. In the next notebook, you'll combine graph databases with vector search to create **GraphRAG**—the next evolution of retrieval-augmented generation.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📚 Part 1: Theory - What Are Graph Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A **graph database** stores data as a network of interconnected nodes and relationships, rather than rows and tables. This structure mirrors how we naturally think about connected information: people know people, products belong to categories, documents cite other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional **relational databases** require complex JOIN operations to traverse relationships. As you add more joins (\"find friends of friends of friends\"), performance degrades exponentially. **Document databases** like MongoDB store data as self-contained documents, but struggle to represent complex relationships efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases solve this by making relationships **first-class citizens**. Relationships are stored directly alongside the data, enabling constant-time traversal regardless of database size. A query that finds \"friends within 3 degrees of separation\" executes in milliseconds even with millions of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Every graph database is built from three fundamental elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes** (also called vertices): Represent entities in your domain\n",
    "   - Examples: Person, Company, Product, Document\n",
    "   - Have **labels** to categorize them (e.g., `:Employee`, `:Department`)\n",
    "   - Contain **properties** with key-value data (e.g., `name: \"Sarah\"`, `age: 35`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationships** (also called edges): Connect nodes and represent how they're related\n",
    "   - Examples: WORKS_FOR, PURCHASED, KNOWS, MANAGES\n",
    "   - Always have a **direction** (though you can query in either direction)\n",
    "   - Also contain **properties** (e.g., `since: 2020`, `strength: 0.8`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Properties**: Key-value pairs that store data on nodes and relationships\n",
    "   - Examples: `salary: 75000`, `created_at: \"2024-01-15\"`, `priority: \"high\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 When to Use Graph Databases vs. Vector Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **graph databases** when:\n",
    "- Your data has complex, multi-hop relationships (organizational hierarchies, social networks)\n",
    "- You need to answer \"how are these connected?\" questions\n",
    "- Relationships are as important as the entities themselves\n",
    "- You're detecting patterns across connections (fraud rings, influence networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **vector databases** when:\n",
    "- You need semantic similarity search (\"find documents similar to this query\")\n",
    "- Your data is unstructured (text, images, audio)\n",
    "- Relationships are less important than content similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The best systems use **both**: vector search to find relevant content, graph traversal to understand context and relationships. You'll learn this hybrid approach in Notebook 2!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LinkedIn Connections**: \"How are you connected to this person?\" requires traversing the professional network graph\n",
    "2. **Fraud Detection**: Banks analyze transaction graphs to find suspicious patterns—multiple accounts transferring to the same destination\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Engines**: \"Users who bought X also bought Y\" is a graph traversal problem\n",
    "4. **Drug Discovery**: Pharmaceutical companies use knowledge graphs to find relationships between proteins, diseases, and compounds\n",
    "5. **IT Operations**: Map dependencies between services to understand cascade failures\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Point: The Power of Relationship Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, finding \"friends of friends\" requires multiple self-joins that get exponentially slower. In a graph database, you simply follow the relationships—performance stays constant regardless of how many \"hops\" you traverse. This is called **index-free adjacency**, and it's what makes graph databases uniquely powerful for connected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph databases store data as **nodes** (entities) connected by **relationships**\n",
    "- Relationships are stored directly, enabling fast traversal across millions of connections\n",
    "- Unlike relational databases, query performance doesn't degrade with relationship depth\n",
    "- Graph databases excel at \"how are these connected?\" questions\n",
    "- They complement vector databases—use graphs for relationships, vectors for similarity\n",
    "- Real-world applications: social networks, fraud detection, recommendations, knowledge management"

    "## 🔤 Part 3: Cypher Basics - The Graph Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Cypher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cypher** is Neo4j's query language for working with graphs. If you know SQL, you'll find Cypher familiar but more intuitive for connected data. Instead of thinking about tables and joins, you think about **patterns** in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher uses ASCII art to represent graph patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "()                    // A node\n",
    "(p:Person)            // A node with label 'Person', aliased as 'p'\n",
    "(p:Person {name: \"Sarah\"})  // A node with properties\n",
    "\n",
    "-->                   // A relationship (directed)\n",
    "-[r]->                // A relationship, aliased as 'r'\n",
    "-[:KNOWS]->           // A relationship with type 'KNOWS'\n",
    "-[:KNOWS {since: 2020}]->  // A relationship with properties\n",
    "\n",
    "(p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)  // A complete pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Cypher Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: Add new nodes and relationships to the graph\n",
    "- **MATCH**: Find patterns in the graph (like SQL's SELECT)\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Filter results based on conditions\n",
    "- **RETURN**: Specify what data to return\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Remove nodes and relationships (use DETACH DELETE to remove relationships too)\n",
    "- **MERGE**: Create if doesn't exist, or match if it does (prevents duplicates)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Point: Cypher's Pattern-Matching Power\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of Cypher is in pattern matching. Instead of writing complex joins, you simply **draw the pattern** you're looking for using ASCII art. The database figures out how to traverse the graph efficiently. Want to find \"people who work with people who know each other\"? Just write the pattern:\n",

    "### ⚠️ Important: The Examples Below Are TEMPORARY Practice DataBefore we build our real company knowledge graph, let's learn Cypher syntax with simple examples. We'll create some test nodes and relationships, experiment with queries, then **delete everything** to start fresh.Think of this section as a **sandbox** or **scratch paper**—we're just learning the syntax!### 🎯 What We'll Do:1. ✏️ **Create** simple test nodes (Alice, Bob, TechCorp)2. 🔍 **Practice** querying them with various Cypher commands3. 🗑️ **Delete everything** to clean up4. 🏗️ **Then** build our real knowledge graph in Part 4**Why are we doing this?** You need to understand Cypher syntax before working with real data. These throwaway examples let you experiment without worrying about messing up the real knowledge graph.Let's practice! 👇"

    "- Use **DETACH DELETE** to remove nodes and their relationships\n",
    "- Properties are specified in curly braces: `{name: \"Alice\", age: 30}`\n",
    "- Pattern matching is intuitive—just draw what you're looking for!\n",

    "In production and in our next notebook, **node and relationship creation is automated**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🤖 **Bulk CSV imports**: Load millions of records from files automatically\n",
    "- 🤖 **ETL pipelines**: Extract data from other databases and transform it into graphs\n",
    "- 🤖 **API integrations**: Real-time data from user actions, IoT sensors, etc.\n",
    "- 🤖 **LLM-powered extraction**: Use AI to automatically extract entities and relationships from unstructured text (this is what we'll do in Notebook 2!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Key Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You design the model once** (manual thinking): \"Employees should be nodes, WORKS_IN should be a relationship\"\n",
    "- **The data insertion is automated** (computer does it): Creating 100,000 employee nodes from a CSV file\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that our knowledge graph is built, we can unleash the real power of graph databases: **pattern matching** and **relationship traversal**. Unlike SQL joins that get slower with complexity, graph traversals maintain constant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-hop queries**: Direct relationships (employee → department)\n",
    "- **Multi-hop queries**: Chained relationships (employee → project → other employees)\n",
    "- **Variable-length paths**: Find connections within N degrees\n",
    "- **Aggregations**: Count, collect, and analyze patterns\n",
    "- **Pattern combinations**: Complex queries matching multiple patterns simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Point: Traversal Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j's **index-free adjacency** means each node physically stores references to its connected relationships. Traversing from one node to another is a simple pointer lookup—no index searches required. This is why graph databases can traverse millions of relationships in milliseconds, while relational databases struggle with just a few joins.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Neo4j Browser?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neo4j Browser** is a built-in, interactive web interface that comes with Neo4j. It's the professional tool for exploring, querying, and visualizing graph databases. Think of it as a graphical SQL client, but for graphs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Features of Neo4j Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive graph visualization**: Click nodes to explore, expand relationships, see properties\n",
    "- **Built-in Cypher editor**: Write and execute queries with autocomplete\n",
    "- **Result visualization**: View results as graphs, tables, or JSON\n",
    "- **Query history**: Save and replay queries\n",
    "- **Graph styling**: Customize colors, sizes, and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Accessing Neo4j Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In a Local Neo4j Installation:**\n",
    "When you run Neo4j on your computer (Neo4j Desktop or local server), you can access Neo4j Browser at:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:7474/browser/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In Google Colab (This Notebook):**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important Limitation**: Neo4j Browser runs on `localhost:7474`, which isn't directly accessible from Colab since Colab runs on Google's servers, not your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Options:**\n",
    "1. **For this exercise**: Use the query-based exploration below (shows results as tables)\n",
    "2. **For full visualization**: Install Neo4j Desktop on your computer and run these queries there\n",
    "3. **Alternative**: Use Neo4j Aura (cloud-hosted) which provides browser access from anywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Exploring Your Graph (Colab-Friendly Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can't use Neo4j Browser directly in Colab, let's explore the graph using queries that return structured results. These same queries work beautifully in Neo4j Browser when run locally!"

    "\n",
    "**What These Visualizations Show:**\n",
    "- **Color-coded nodes**: Each entity type (Employee, Department, Project, Skill) has its own color\n",
    "- **Directed relationships**: Arrows show the direction of relationships (e.g., Employee → Department)\n",
    "- **Network patterns**: See how entities cluster and connect across the organization\n",
    "- **Graph structure**: Understand the shape and density of your knowledge graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights from Our Visualizations:**\n",
    "1. **Department Structure**: Shows how employees are organized and who manages whom\n",
    "2. **Project Teams**: Reveals which employees work together and what skills they bring\n",
    "3. **Skill Distribution**: Identifies expertise across departments (e.g., Python is widely distributed)\n",
    "4. **Cross-Department Work**: Highlights collaboration patterns between departments\n",
    "5. **Management Hierarchy**: Shows reporting chains from leadership down\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Comparison to Neo4j Browser:**\n",
    "- These matplotlib visualizations work great in Colab and show the graph structure clearly\n",
    "- Neo4j Browser adds interactivity: click nodes to expand, filter, and explore dynamically\n",
    "- Both approaches are valuable: matplotlib for static analysis, Neo4j Browser for interactive exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "For production applications, consider:\n",
    "- **Plotly** or **Pyvis** for interactive web-based graph visualizations\n",
    "- **Neo4j Bloom** for business-user-friendly graph exploration\n",
